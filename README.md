# react-for-gutenberg-wp
This repository showcases my learning of React.js and its integration with WordPress Gutenberg blocks. It covers core React concepts like components, props, state management with useState, useEffect for side effects, and event handling. These are applied to build dynamic custom Gutenberg blocks for WordPress.
