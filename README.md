# React for Gutenberg WordPress

This repository is part of my learning journey where I am combining React.js with custom Gutenberg block development in WordPress. As I go through a React crash course from YouTube, I am practicing key concepts and integrating them into Gutenberg blocks for WordPress.

## Course Overview

This crash course covers the fundamentals of React, including:

- **React Components:** Building reusable UI components.
- **Props in React:** Passing data between components using props.
- **State Management (useState Hook):** Managing dynamic data within components.
- **useEffect Hook:** Handling side effects like fetching data, updating the DOM, etc.
- **Event Handling:** Handling events like clicks, form submissions, etc.
- **Data Fetching:** Retrieving data from APIs and displaying it within components.

## Topics Covered

### 1. React Components
Learned how to create simple and reusable components. Each component is isolated, allowing better modularization of the project.

### 2. Props in React
Practiced passing data between parent and child components using props to create dynamic UIs.

### 3. State Management with `useState`
Explored the `useState` hook to manage the internal state of components, updating the UI based on user interactions.

### 4. Side Effects with `useEffect`
Understood the `useEffect` hook for side effects like data fetching, and working with APIs.

### 5. Event Handling
Implemented event handling in React components, such as handling user inputs and button clicks.

### 6. Data Fetching
Integrated API data fetching using React, and displayed dynamic content fetched from APIs.

## Project Structure

This repository also includes my initial steps in creating **custom Gutenberg blocks** for WordPress using React. The block creation process is handled using WordPress's `@wordpress/scripts` package, allowing me to build dynamic blocks powered by React.
